# REStfulAPI 

## Overview

Implementation of Test Cases: CRUD Pattern, for a pet store sample hosted at http://localhost:8080/. 

This is a java project to build a stand-alone server and other project which implements REST Assured. 

REST Assured is an open-source (free) Java library available for testing primarily the RESTful web services. 

REST Assured is a Java domain-specific language (DSL) for simplifying testing of REST-based web services built on top of HTTP. 

It supports most commonly used HTTP verbs like GET, POST, PUT/PATCH DELETE, OPTIONS, HEAD which can be used to validate & verify the response of these requests.

This demo shows a complete design using the CRUD pattern, where we can modularize and separate the data layer, API calls, test codes. 

These test cases were oriented towards handling the **pets** option. And they are completely designed independent of the testing framework. This allows for code reuse, modularity, and better code maintenance.



_Dependency Details_

**io.rest-assured**      --> Rest Assured for testing API interactions(request & response),extract json/xml path.
**org.testng**           --> Designing the Test Frmework using TestNG Classes.
**com.google.code.gson** --> Represent the request body data in the from of java objects like Map <--> JSONformat.
**com.github.javafaker** --> To supply fake data for testing while sending request.
**com.jayway.jsonpath**  --> Extract data specifically from JSON file using jayway jsonpath.

_environment.java_ class to register all the available services with end-points
_petEndpoints.java_ class to perform Create, Read, Update, Delete requests to the services using the above-created end-points
_pet.java_ class to represents the data structure of the user payload which is in JSON format
_testPets.java_ class to perform the API Testing for the services using the TestNG class


Note: Run the testPets.java class as TestNG test to observe results of tests. Each time you run the code, a different petId and petName is generated by the Java Faker class.



To run (with Maven)
To run the server, run this task:

mvn package jetty:run
This will start Jetty embedded on port 8080.

To run (via Docker)
Expose port 8080 from the image and access petstore via the exposed port. You can then add and delete pets as you see fit.

Example:

docker build -t swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable .
docker pull swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
docker run  --name swaggerapi-petstore3 -d -p 8080:8080 swaggerapi/petstore3:unstable
Testing the server
Once started, you can navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/v3/openapi.json to view the Swagger Resource Listing. This tells you that the server is up and ready to demonstrate Swagger.

Using the UI
There is an HTML5-based API tool bundled in this sample--you can view it it at http://localhost:8080. This lets you inspect the API using an interactive UI. You can access the source of this code from here
